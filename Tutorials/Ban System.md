# How To Create A Ban System
Actually it's quite simple let's get started.

<details>

<summary>Step 1: Data Storage</summary>
You can simply use github to store the ban date like so:

```lua
    --[[
        Credits: ro0ti
        GitHub: https://github.com/ro0ti
    ]]--

    local BanLib = {}

    function BanLib:CheckBanned(check_id)
        local data = {}
        local banned = false
        local banned_reason = ""
        for _,v in BannedList do
            local id = v.id
            local reason = v.reason
            if game.Players.LocalPlayer.UserId == check_id then
                banned = true
                banned_reason = v.reason
            end
        end
        data = {
            banned: banned,
            banned_reason: banned_reason
        }
        return data
    end

    bannedList = {
        [0] = {
            ["id"] = 0,
            ["reason"] = "Developer test reason"
        },
    }

    return BanLib
```

This will return our data on our script side. Id is the User ID and reason is abviously the reason why him/her was banned.

<summary>Step 2: Check The Ban Script Wise</summary>
Now just call the library above checking the status and what to do with it.

```lua
   local BanLib = loadstring(game:HttpGet('YOUR GITHUB LINK/BanLib.lua'))()
   local BanResult = BanLib:CheckBanned(game.Players.LocalPlayer.UserId)

    if (BanResult == true) then
        -- Banned: Do what you want..
    else
        -- Not Banned: Load normally..
    end
```

That's it you have successfully created a ban system! Enjoy and remember to leave credits where it's due.
